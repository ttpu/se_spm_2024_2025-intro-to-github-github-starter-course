# What I've Learned and Areas of Confusion

## What I've Learned
Throughout this project, I've gained valuable insights into several areas:

- **Version Control with Git**: I now understand how to manage repositories, make commits, and track changes effectively.
- **Branching**: Creating, switching, and merging branches has given me a new way to organize different features or fixes separately.
- **Markdown**: This simple yet powerful formatting language is great for documentation, allowing me to structure my thoughts clearly.

## Areas of Confusion
While I’ve made progress, there are still a few things that puzzle me:

- **Merge Conflicts**: I understand why they happen but resolving them efficiently, especially in larger files, is still a bit tricky for me.
- **Pull Requests and Reviews**: Although I know how to create pull requests, I’m still unsure about best practices for reviewing and approving them.
  
## Style Experimentation
I've also played around with different markdown styles:
- **Headers**: Like the ones you see above help break content into digestible sections.
- **Lists**: Both ordered and unordered lists allow for neat, organized information.
  
Lastly, I'm exploring **blockquotes** and **code blocks**:
> "The more you practice, the better you'll get!"
  
```python
# Sample code block
def greet():
    return "Hello, Markdown!"
